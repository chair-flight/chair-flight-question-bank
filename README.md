## Contributing

All content contributions are more than welcome. Content is written using
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which is a superset of
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). All boilerplate is already
put in place, so if you want to write some content, or add questions... go
ahead!

## Versioning

The goal is to use semantic version, nevertheless until version 1.0.0 is
released, we reserve the right of doing breaking changes unannounced on minor
releases. (i.e version `0.0.22` may contain breaking changes from version
`0.0.21`).

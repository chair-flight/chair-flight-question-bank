# Autobrake

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.04.03.04.01** -- Describe the operating principle of an autobrake
    system.
2.  **021.04.03.04.02** -- Explain why the anti-skid system must be available
    when using autobrakes.
3.  **021.04.03.04.03** -- Explain the difference between the three modes of
    operation of an autobrake system: OFF (system off or reset); Armed (the
    system is ready to operate under certain conditions); Activated/Deactivated
    (application of pressure on brakes).
4.  **021.04.03.04.04** -- Describe how an autobrake system setting will either
    apply maximum braking (RTO or MAX) or result in a given rate of
    deceleration, where the amount of braking applied may be affected by: the
    use of reverse thrust; slippery runway.

<Text variant="multipleCorrect" select={5}>
  Which of these statements in relation to the autobrake system in RTO mode are
  correct?
</Text>
<Option subject={[[]]}>
  With RTO inoperable, take off might not be allowed because the minimum break
  distance with manual braking is much longer.
</Option>
<Option subject={[[]]}>
  After RTO braking action, the brakes block the wheel rims.
</Option>
<Option why="After RTO braking action, brakes remain in the locked position, so pressure remains.">
  After RTO braking action, the hydraulic pressure is reduced to zero
</Option>
<Option why="After RTO braking action, brakes remain in the locked position.">
  After RTO braking action, The brake pressure is released.
</Option>
<Option>RTO mode can be used for take-off and Landing</Option>
<Option>
  Manual braking is the most efficient way to decelerate an aircraft
</Option>

  <Option why="the RTO applies a fixed hydraulic pressure, but the force that is applied varies with weight on the wheels.">
    RTO has a fixed force with which the aircraft must be decelerated
  </Option>
</Question>

  <Text variant="oneCorrect">
    Assume an autobrake system that is ON and armed. When will the system revert
    to normal anti-skid function?
  </Text>
<Option subject={[[]]}>
  When any of the throttle levers are advanced to take-off thrust
</Option>

  <Option>Once the nose wheel touches the ground</Option>
  <Option>When spoilers are manually deployed</Option>
  <Option>If skidding occurs on any wheel</Option>

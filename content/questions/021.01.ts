    This question is a bit special. Learning objective \`021.03.02.01.01\` tries
    to highlight the ideal properties of hydraulic fluids which include being
    "non corrosive". Despite this you should be aware that Skydrol, the hydraulic
    fluid most commonly used in modern airliners is highly corrosive, specially
    at high temperatures.

    You should also be aware that Skydrol is highly toxic to humans. 

    All other fluids are relatively non corrosive.

  explanation: dedent`
    The primary drive for an accelerated corrosion is humidity. As such you 
    can put in the top of the list a Rainforest (close to 100% humidity), and
    Mediterranean climate (70%+ humidity on a daily basis). 

    The arctic climate, despite of being full of water in frozen state has a 
    permanent humidity of 0%, while a desert still experiences some degree
    of humidity, albeit very low. As such the correct ordering from the 
    highest to the lowest rate of corrosion should be:
   
    3. Rainforest  
    2. Mediterranean 
    1. Desert  
    4. Arctic

    - high-pressure (HP) pump;
    - fuel manifold;
    - fuel nozzles;
    - HP fuel cock;
    - fuel control;
    - hydromechanical unit.
2.  **021.11.03.01.02** -- Name the two types of engine-driven high-pressure
    pumps, such as: gear-type; swash plate-type.
3.  **021.11.03.01.03** -- State the tasks of the fuel control unit.
4.  **021.11.03.01.04** -- List the possible input parameters to a fuel control
    unit to achieve a given thrust/power setting.

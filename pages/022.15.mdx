# DIGITAL CIRCUITS AND COMPUTERS

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.15.01.01.01** -- Define a "computer" as a machine for manipulating data
    according to a list of instructions.
2.  **022.15.01.01.02** -- Explain the term "bus" being used as a term for a
    facility (wiring, optical fibre, etc.) transferring data between different
    parts of a computer, both internally and externally.
3.  **022.15.01.01.03** -- Define the terms "hardware" and "software".
4.  **022.15.01.01.04** -- With the help of the relevant 022 references, give
    examples of airborne computers and list the possible peripheral equipment for
    each system, such as:
    - ADC with pitot probe(s),
    - static port(s) and indicators;
    - FMS with GPS,
    - CDU/MCDU and ND;
    - GPWS with radio altimeter,
    - ADC and ND.

<Question id="ST5T542R73" lo={["022.15.01.01.01"]}>
  <Text variant="oneCorrect">A computer is a ...</Text>

{" "}

<Option
  correct
  why="This is the word by word definition that EASA expects you to memorize."
>
  A machine for manipulating data according to a list of instructions
</Option>

{" "}

<Option why="Definition of an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU).">
  A digital circuit that performs basic operations.
</Option>

{" "}

<Option why="Not necessarily true: computers predate microprocessors by a few decades.">
  a microprocessor.
</Option>

  <Option why="Not a very accurate definition since a computer typically includes memory to store instructions and data.">
    a component, normally called a CPU, that performs instructions stored in
    memory.
  </Option>
</Question>

<Question id="ST5T542R78" lo={["022.15.01.01.02"]}>
  <Text variant="oneCorrect">
    In a computer architecture, a "bus" is a system that:
  </Text>

{" "}

<Option>performs basic logic operations.</Option>
<Option>performs basic arithmetic operations.</Option>
<Option correct>transfers data between computer components.</Option>
<Option>ensures sequencing and co-ordination of operations.</Option>

  <Explanation>
    The most popular computer bus, is the USB (Universal Serial Bus), and it
    allows to connect pretty much any device to a computer. Other buses exist
    (ie.: SATA for disk drives)

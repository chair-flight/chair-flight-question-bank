# Stress, strain and loads

## Learning Objectives

1. **021.01.02.01.01** -- Explain how stress and strain are always present in an
   aircraft structure both when parked and during manoeuvring. Remark: Stress is
   the internal force per unit area inside a structural part as a result of
   external loads. Strain is the deformation caused by the action of stress on a
   material.
2. **021.01.02.01.02** -- Describe the following types of loads that an aircraft
   may be subjected to, when they occur, and how a pilot may affect their
   magnitude: static loads; dynamic loads; cyclic loads.
3. **021.01.02.01.03** -- Describe the areas typically prone to stress that
   should be given particular attention during a pre-flight inspection, and
   highlight the limited visual cues of any deformation that may be evident.

  <Text variant="oneCorrect">
    During a pre-flight inspection, what could indicate stress damage on an
    aircraft?
  </Text>
  <Explanation>
    Key word here is "stress damage". All other options refer to other types of
    damage

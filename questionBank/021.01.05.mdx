1. **021.01.05.01.01** -- Explain the following terms: hard-time or fixed-time
   maintenance; on-condition maintenance; condition monitoring.

## Summary

### Hard / Fixed time maintenance

A component is replaced or overhauled after a set number of hours, cycles or
operations, regardless of their condition.

### On Condition maintenance

A component is replaced or overhauled when indications of its deteriorating
condition are detected. For example, a maintenance check could include steps to
visually inspect for corrosion on specific screw heads, and as soon as it is
detected the whole component is replaced.

### Condition monitoring

Similar to **On Condition maintenance** but leveraging modern day technology to
continuously monitor specific parameters that could indicate failure.

# Structural limitations

## Learning Objectives

1. **021.02.06.01.01** -- Define and explain the following maximum structural
   masses: maximum ramp mass; maximum take-off mass; maximum zero fuel mass;
   maximum landing mass. Remark: These limitations may also be found in the
   relevant part of Subjects 031 "Mass and balance", 032 "Performance
   (aeroplane)" and 034 "Performance (helicopter)".
2. **021.02.06.01.02** -- Explain that airframe life is limited by fatigue,
   created by alternating stress and the number of load cycles.
3. **021.02.06.01.03** -- Explain the maximum structural masses: maximum
   take-off mass.
4. **021.02.06.01.04** -- Explain that airframe life is limited by fatigue,
   created by load cycles.

## Questions

<Question id='5QUV21bvCU'  lo={['021.02.06.01.04']}> 
  <Text  variant="oneCorrect">
    What is it the main reason that makes it undesirable for an aeroplane designed 
    for long distance flights to be used for short distances?
  </Text>
  <Option id='5QUV21bvCU-1'  alwaysCorrect>
    The lifetime of the fatigue sensitive parts has been based on a determined load spectrum.
  </Option>
  <Option id='5QUV21bvCU-2'>
    The procedures and check lists would be too long for short flights.
  </Option>
  <Option id='5QUV21bvCU-3'>
    The fuel consumption for these type of aeroplanes would be excessive in such short flights.
  </Option>
  <Option id='5QUV21bvCU-4'>
    The fuel tanks would be mostly empty causing stresses at the wing joint that would otherwise not be common.
  </Option>
  <Explanation>
    All the provided answers are, in a way, correct. However the greatest limitation on an airframe lifetime, is the ammount
    of compression-decompression cycles that it goes through. Most long range aircraft have lifespans significantly higher than 
    a smaller aircraft, because they undergo one or two compression cycles a day, instead of 6 or more.

    Using aircraft designed for long-range flights in short flights would greatly diminish their lifespan, and severely impact
    their economic return.

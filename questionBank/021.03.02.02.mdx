# System components: design, operation, degraded modes of operation, indications and warnings

## Learning Objectives

1. [021.03.02.02.01] -- Explain the working principle of a hydraulic system.
2. [021.03.02.02.02] -- Describe the difference in the principle of operation
   between a constant pressure system and a system pressurised only on specific
   demand.
3. [021.03.02.02.03] -- State the differences in the principle of operation
   between a passive hydraulic system (without a pressure pump) and an active
   hydraulic system (with a pressure pump).
4. [021.03.02.02.04] -- List the main advantages and disadvantages of system
   actuation by hydraulic or purely mechanical means with respect to: weight;
   size; force.
5. [021.03.02.02.05] -- List the main uses of hydraulic systems.
6. [021.03.02.02.06] -- State that hydraulic systems can be classified as either
   high pressure (typically 3000 psi or higher) or low pressure (typically up to
   2000 psi).
7. [021.03.02.02.07] -- State that a high-pressure hydraulic system is typically
   operating at 3000 psi but on some aircraft a hydraulic pressure of 4000 to
   5000 psi may also be used.
8. [021.03.02.02.08] -- Explain the working principle of a low-pressure (0–2000
   psi) system.
9. [021.03.02.02.09] -- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of a
   high-pressure system over a low-pressure system.
10. [021.03.02.02.10] -- Describe the working principle and functions of
    pressure pumps including: constant pressure pump (swash plate or cam plate);
    pressure pump whose output is dependent on pump revolutions per minute (rpm)
    (gear type).
11. [021.03.02.02.11] -- Explain the following different sources of hydraulic
    pressure, their typical application and potential operational limitations:
    manual; engine gearbox; electrical; air (pneumatic and ram-air turbine);
    hydraulic (power transfer unit) or reversible motor pumps; accessory.
12. [021.03.02.02.12] -- Explain the following different sources of hydraulic
    pressure, their typical application and potential operational limitations:
    manual; engine; gearbox; electrical.
13. [021.03.02.02.13] -- Describe the working principle and functions of the
    following hydraulic system components: reservoir (pressurised and
    unpressurised); accumulators; case drain lines and fluid cooler return
    lines; piston actuators (single- and double-acting); hydraulic motors;
    filters; non-return (check) valves; relief valves; restrictor valves;
    elector valves (linear and basic rotary selectors, two and four ports);
    bypass valves; shuttle valves; fire shut‑off valves; priority valves; fuse
    valves; pressure and return pipes.
14. [021.03.02.02.14] -- Explain the function of the demand pump installed on
    many transport aeroplanes.
15. [021.03.02.02.15] -- Explain how redundancy is obtained by giving examples.
16. [021.03.02.02.16] -- Interpret a typical hydraulic system schematic to the
    level of detail as found in an aircraft flight crew operating manual (FCOM).
17. [021.03.02.02.17] -- Explain the implication of a high system demand.
18. [021.03.02.02.18] -- List and describe the instruments and alerts for
    monitoring a hydraulic system.
19. [021.03.02.02.19] -- State the indications and explain the implications of
    the following malfunctions: system leak or low level; low pressure; high
    temperature.

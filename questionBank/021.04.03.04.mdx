# Autobrake

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.04.03.04.01** -- Describe the operating principle of an autobrake
    system.
2.  **021.04.03.04.02** -- Explain why the anti-skid system must be available
    when using autobrakes.
3.  **021.04.03.04.03** -- Explain the difference between the three modes of
    operation of an autobrake system: OFF (system off or reset); Armed (the
    system is ready to operate under certain conditions); Activated/Deactivated
    (application of pressure on brakes).
4.  **021.04.03.04.04** -- Describe how an autobrake system setting will either
    apply maximum braking (RTO or MAX) or result in a given rate of deceleration,
    where the amount of braking applied may be affected by: the use of reverse
    thrust; slippery runway.

    The correct statement in relation to the autobrake system is...
  </Text>

  <Text variant="oneTwo">
    Which of these statements in relation to the autobrake system are correct?
  </Text>

  <Text variant="multipleCorrect" select={5}>
    Which of these statements in relation to the autobrake system are correct?
  </Text>

  <Option correct why="This is true, and required by technical requirements for type certification.">
    Without pilot interference an autobrake system continues to operate until
    standstill
  </Option>

  <Option correct>
    During landing and RTO, an autobrake keeps operating until the pilot presses
    the brake pedals
  </Option>

  <Option correct>
    During landing an autobrake keeps operating when reverse thrust is selected
  </Option>

  <Option correct>
    When using the lowest autobrake setting and reverse thrust, the brake
    temperature will be reduced.
  </Option>

  <Option correct why="The autobrake system maintains a pre-selected deceleration rate, adapting the brake force as the plane slows down, or as other means of breaking become active (i.e: thrust reverser). Do not confuse with RTO mode where all the available brake pressure is applied!">
    An autobrake gives constant deceleration on dry runway
  </Option>

  <Option why="Although the second part of the statement is correct, an INOP autobrake just increases the Take off distance required. If enough runway is available, take off is still allowed.">
    In general, if the autobrake system is inoperative, take-off is forbidden as
    manual braking will never achieve the brake rate of the autobrake system.
  </Option>

  <Option why="Not correct since in most aircraft the autobrake engages a couple of seconds after touch down">
    An armed autobrake system will always try to achieve the selected
    deceleration level directly after main wheel touchdown
  </Option>

  <Option why="RTO is only disabled if braking occurs above a relatively high speed (90kts for a 737-800).">
    Manual braking while taxing will disarm the RTO mode
  </Option>

  <Option why="Not correct since it also depends on pressure altitude, temperature, and a myriad of other factors">
    For a given touchdown speed on a dry runway without the use of reverse
    thrust, the stopping distance solely depends on the selected ABS setting and
    weight of the aeroplane.
  </Option>

  <Option why="This is not necessarily true, and depends a lot on aircraft type.">
    A take-off warning will be generated if the autobrake system has not been
    armed.
  </Option>

  <Option>
    In most aircraft, there is an option in the autobrake to select the exact
    landing distance.
  </Option>

  <Option why="Aerobraking with INOP anti-skid would result in a hydroplaning aircraft for wet runways which is not a good idea.">
    An autobrake can be used if anti-skid is inoperative
  </Option>

  <Option why="This is not correct, as the autobrake maintains a constant deceleration ratio. Only in RTO mode is the deceleration rate maximum">
    An autobrake will always stop the aeroplane within the shortest possible
    distance
  </Option>

<Question id="RESK47GB58" lo={["021.04.03.04.01"]}>
  <Text variant="oneCorrect">
    The correct statement in relation to the autobrake system in RTO mode is...
  </Text>

  <Text variant="oneTwo">
    Which of these statements in relation to the autobrake system in RTO mode
    are correct?
  </Text>

  <Text variant="multipleCorrect" select={5}>
    Which of these statements in relation to the autobrake system in RTO mode
    are correct?
  </Text>

  <Option subject={[[]]}>
    With RTO inoperable, take off might not be allowed because the minimum break
    distance with manual braking is much longer.
  </Option>

  <Option subject={[[]]}>
    After RTO braking action, the brakes block the wheel rims.
  </Option>

  <Option why="After RTO braking action, brakes remain in the locked position, so pressure remains.">
    After RTO braking action, the hydraulic pressure is reduced to zero
  </Option>

  <Option why="After RTO braking action, brakes remain in the locked position.">
    After RTO braking action, The brake pressure is released.
  </Option>

  <Option>RTO mode can be used for take-off and Landing</Option>

  <Option>
    Manual braking is the most efficient way to decelerate an aircraft
  </Option>

  <Option why="the RTO applies a fixed hydraulic pressure, but the force that is applied varies with weight on the wheels.">
    RTO has a fixed force with which the aircraft must be decelerated
  </Option>
</Question>

<Question id="FIAR77L7GS" lo={["021.04.03.04.03"]}>
  <Text variant="oneCorrect">
    Assume an autobrake system that is ON and armed. When will the system revert
    to normal anti-skid function?
  </Text>

  <Option subject={[[]]}>
    When any of the throttle levers are advanced to take-off thrust
  </Option>

  <Option>Once the nose wheel touches the ground</Option>
  <Option>When spoilers are manually deployed</Option>
  <Option>If skidding occurs on any wheel</Option>

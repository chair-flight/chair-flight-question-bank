    What is the basic principle of a fully <Subject /> flight control system?
  </Text>

  <Option subject="manual">
    The flight control surfaces are connected to the flight deck controls by
    means of mechanical links only.
  </Option>

  <Option>
    A system that is an irreversible system because there is no flight deck
    flight control feedback when a flight control surface is in motion.
  </Option>

  <Option>
    A system that is manually operated by the pilot by means of the flight
    control elements and is powered by an hydraulic system.
  </Option>

  <Option>
    The deflection angle of the flight control surface will vary with airspeed,
    therefore, the flight control forces are constant.

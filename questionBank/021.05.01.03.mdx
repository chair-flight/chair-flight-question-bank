# Fully powered controls (irreversible)

## Learning Objectives

1. **021.05.01.03.01** -- Explain the basic principle of a fully powered control
   system.
2. **021.05.01.03.02** -- Explain the concept of irreversibility in a flight
   control system.
3. **021.05.01.03.03** -- Explain the need for a "feel system" in a fully
   powered control system.
4. **021.05.01.03.04** -- Explain the operating principle of a stabiliser trim
   system in a fully powered control system.
5. **021.05.01.03.05** -- Explain the operating principle of rudder and aileron
   trim in a fully powered control system.

<Question id='Q8cypinbzR' variant='definition' lo={['021.05.01.03.02']}>
  <Text variant='oneCorrect'>Trimming of aileron and rudder in an <Subject /> flight control system...</Text>
  <Option id='Q8cypinbzR-1' subject="irreversible">is achieved by adjusting the "zero force point" of the feel system</Option>
  <Option id='Q8cypinbzR-3' subject='reversible'>is achieved by adjusting the neutral point of the flight control actuator</Option>
  <Option id='Q8cypinbzR-4'>is not possible</Option>
  <Option id='Q8cypinbzR-5'>is not necessary</Option>
  <Explanation>
     If you have ever flown a small aircraft, you are used to reversible flight controls and how they
     are trimmed. You were probably thought to hold the control yoke in the position that maintains 
     straight and level flight, and then adjust the trim until you no longer have to do force to maintain
     the yoke in that position. You have "adjusted the neutral point of the flight control actuator".

     An irreversible control system is different. It's basically the same experience you get with a cheap
     joystick playing flight simulator. The stick will always center in the same position, but you can still
     trim the aircraft, but the "zero force point" of the feel system will change.

# System components, design, operation, indications and warnings, degraded modes of operation, jamming

## Learning Objectives

1. **021.05.01.05.01** -- List and describe the function of the following
   components of a flight control system: actuators; control valves; cables;
   electrical wiring; control surface position sensors.
2. **021.05.01.05.02** -- Explain how redundancy is obtained in primary flight
   control systems of large transport aeroplanes.
3. **021.05.01.05.03** -- Explain the danger of control jamming and the means of
   retaining sufficient control capability.
4. **021.05.01.05.04** -- Explain the methods of locking the controls on the
   ground and describe "gust or control lock" warnings.
5. **021.05.01.05.05** -- Explain the concept of a rudder deflection limitation
   (rudder limiter) system and the various means of implementation (rudder ratio
   changer, variable stops, blow-back).

<Question lo={["021.05.01.05.04"]}>
  <Text variant="oneTwo">Which of these statements are correct?</Text>
  <Option subject={[[]]}>
    Manual Flight Controls should have a gust lock.
  </Option>
  <Option subject={[[]]}>
    Reversible Flight Controls should have a gust lock.
  </Option>
  <Option
    alwaysCorrect
    why="In irreversible systems, a gust lock is not needed since the hydraulic actuator is able to lock itself in the failed or neutral position."
  >
    There is no need for a gust lock on irreversible flight controls
  </Option>
  <Option>
    There should be suitable design precautions to prevent flight with the gust
    lock engaged.
  </Option>
  <Option>
    A gust lock can be used in flight to reduce the effects of turbulence.
  </Option>
  <Option>Manual flight controls do not require a gust lock</Option>
  <Option>Reversible Flight Controls do not require a gust lock.</Option>

    Which of these statements about rudder limiting are correct?
  </Text>
  <Option subject={[[]]}>
    A rudder ratio changer system reduces the rudder deflection for a given
    pedal deflection as the IAS increases
  </Option>
  <Option subject={[[]]}>
    A variable stop system limits both rudder and rudder pedal deflection as the
    IAS increases.
  </Option>
  <Option>
    A rudder ratio changer system reduces the rudder deflection for a given
    pedal deflection as the IAS decreases
  </Option>
  <Option>
    A variable stop system limits both rudder and rudder pedal deflection as the
    IAS decreases.

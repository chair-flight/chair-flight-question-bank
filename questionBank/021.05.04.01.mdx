# Composition, explanation of operation, modes of operation

## Learning Objectives

1. [021.05.04.01.01] -- Explain that an FBW flight control system is composed of
   the following: pilot"s input command (control column/sidestick/rudder
   pedals); electrical signalling paths, including: pilot input to computer;
   computer to flight control surfaces; feedback from aircraft response to
   computer; flight control computers; actuators; flight control surfaces.
2. [021.05.04.01.02] -- State the advantages of an FBW system in comparison with
   a conventional flight control system including: weight; pilot workload;
   flight-envelope protection.
3. [021.05.04.01.03] -- Explain why an FBW system is always irreversible.
4. [021.05.04.01.04] -- Explain the different modes of operation: normal
   operation (e.g. normal law or normal mode); downgraded operation (e.g.
   alternate law or secondary mode); direct law.
5. [021.05.04.01.05] -- Describe the implications of mode degradation in
   relation to pilot workload and flight-envelope protection.
6. [021.05.04.01.06] -- Intentionally left blank
7. [021.05.04.01.07] -- For aircraft using sidestick for manual control,
   describe the implications of: dual control input made by the pilot; the
   control takeover facility available to the pilot.
8. [021.05.04.01.08] -- Intentionally left blank
9. [021.05.04.01.09] -- Explain why several types of computers are needed and
   why they should be dissimilar.
10. [021.05.04.01.10] -- Explain why several control surfaces on every axis are
    needed on FBW aircraft.
11. [021.05.04.01.11] -- Explain why several sensors are needed on critical
    parameters.

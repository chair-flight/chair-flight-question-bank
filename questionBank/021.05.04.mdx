# Aeroplane: fly-by-wire (FBW) control systems

## Learning Objectives

1. **021.05.04.01.01** -- Explain that an FBW flight control system is composed
   of the following: pilot"s input command (control column/sidestick/rudder
   pedals); electrical signalling paths, including: pilot input to computer;
   computer to flight control surfaces; feedback from aircraft response to
   computer; flight control computers; actuators; flight control surfaces.
2. **021.05.04.01.02** -- State the advantages of an FBW system in comparison
   with a conventional flight control system including: weight; pilot workload;
   flight-envelope protection.
3. **021.05.04.01.03** -- Explain why an FBW system is always irreversible.
4. **021.05.04.01.04** -- Explain the different modes of operation: normal
   operation (e.g. normal law or normal mode); downgraded operation (e.g.
   alternate law or secondary mode); direct law.
5. **021.05.04.01.05** -- Describe the implications of mode degradation in
   relation to pilot workload and flight-envelope protection.
6. **021.05.04.01.07** -- For aircraft using sidestick for manual control,
   describe the implications of: dual control input made by the pilot; the
   control takeover facility available to the pilot.
7. **021.05.04.01.09** -- Explain why several types of computers are needed and
   why they should be dissimilar.
8. **021.05.04.01.10** -- Explain why several control surfaces on every axis are
   needed on FBW aircraft.
9. **021.05.04.01.11** -- Explain why several sensors are needed on critical
   parameters.

## Summary

- **PFC**: Primary Flight Computer. Receives Pilot commands, checks them for
  viability and errors, and converts them into the final digital signal to be
  sent to the **ACE**.
- **ACE**: Actuator Control Electronics. Recieves a digital signal from the
  **PFC** and converts it into an analogue signal to be sent to the **PCU**.
- **PCU**: Power Control Unit. Receives electric analogue and activates an
  Hydraulic actuator

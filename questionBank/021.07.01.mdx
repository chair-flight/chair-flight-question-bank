# Types, design, operation, indications

... and warnings, operational limitations

## Learning Objectives

1. **021.07.01.01.01** -- Explain the concepts of anti‑icing and de‑icing.
2. **021.07.01.01.02** -- Name the components of an aircraft which can be protected from ice accretion.
3. **021.07.01.01.03** -- State that on some aeroplanes the tail does not have an ice-protection system.
4. **021.07.01.01.04** -- State the different types of anti-icing/de-icing systems and describe their operating principle: hot air; electrical; fluid.
5. **021.07.01.01.05** -- Describe the operating principle of the inflatable boot de-icing system.

## Summary

### mechanical systems using air pressure

This device consists of 2 sets of holes facing the incoming air. One set contains just one
large hole, and the second set contains several small holes. Summed all together, the small 
holes have the same area as the large hole. Because of this, under normal conditions, the 
pressure measured from both sets will be the same, that is, there is 0 pressure differential.

When Icing conditions are observed, the slow holes will close much faster than the big hole,
generating a pressure differential which can be measured. This will trigger an ice warning light
in the cockpit. Eventually, the big hole will close as well, and the pressure differential will
be 0. However, this will not dismiss the alarm light.

When de-icing heating is turned on, the ice will melt much faster on the smaller holes, causing,
again a pressure differential, but with opposite direction. This will cause the alarm light to be
dismissed.

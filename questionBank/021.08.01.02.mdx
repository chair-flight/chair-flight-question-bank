    What is the function of the following component in a fuel system: \*\*

    <Subject />

    \*\* ?
  </Text>

  <Option subject={[["boost pump"]]}>
    To pressurize the fuel system so that fuel reaches the engines.
  </Option>

  <Option subject={[["pressure valves", "relief valves"]]}>
    To prevent the accumulation of excessive pressure in the fuel system.
  </Option>

  <Option subject={[["filter"], ["strainer"]]}>
    To remove solid particles that could otherwise damage the fuel system.
  </Option>

  <Option subject={[["ventilation system"]]}>
    To prevent the creation of low pressure or excessive overpressure in the
    tank.
  </Option>

  <Option subject={[["sump"]]}>
    To provide a single point in the fuel tank where fuel accumulates as the
    tank empties.
  </Option>

  <Option subject={[["drain valve"]]}>
    To take allow the sampling of fuel and the emptying of the tanks for
    maintenance.
  </Option>

  <Option>
    To allow for rapid fuel dumping in the case of emergency landing with an
    excessive landing mass.
  </Option>

  <Option why="could be confused with 'filter' and 'strainer', but remember, these 2 devices are purely mechanical and they prevent the accumulation of particles, but don't detect them, at least not in any useful time.">
    To detect particles and contaminants that could damage the engine.
  </Option>

  <Option>
    To remove excess fuel from the cylinders after a failed attempt to start the
    engine.
  </Option>

  <Option>To prevent fuel freezing during flight in icing conditions.</Option>

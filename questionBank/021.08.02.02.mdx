# Design, operation, system components, indications

## Learning Objectives

1. **021.08.02.02.01** -- Explain the function of the fuel system: lines;
   centrifugal boost pump; pressure valves; fuel shut-off valve; filter,
   strainer; tanks (wing, tip, fuselage, tail); bafflers/baffles; sump; vent
   system; drain; fuel-quantity sensor; fuel-temperature sensor;
   refuelling/defueling system; fuel dump/jettison system.
2. **021.08.02.02.02** -- Name the main components of the fuel system and state
   their location and their function: trim fuel tanks; bafflers;
   refuelling/defueling system; fuel dump/jettison system. Remark: For
   completion of list, please see 021.08 01.02 (02..
3. **021.08.02.02.03** -- Interpret a typical fuel system schematic to the level
   of detail as found in an aircraft FCOM.
4. **021.08.02.02.04** -- Explain the limitations in the event of loss of
   booster pump fuel pressure.
5. **021.08.02.02.05** -- Describe the use and purpose of drip sticks (manual
   magnetic indicators) (may also be known as dip stick or drop stick).
6. **021.08.02.02.06** -- Explain the considerations for fitting a fuel
   dump/jettison system and, if fitted, its function.

## Summary

### Baffles and Baffle valves

- Baffles - Dampen the fuel movement
- Baffle valves - PRevent outward movement of flow (from the wing root to the
  tip)

### Dip sticks

The quantity of fuel is determined by using measurements from the dip stick and
data tables in the aircraft documentation.

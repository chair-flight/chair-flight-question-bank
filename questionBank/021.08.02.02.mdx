## Learning Objectives

1. [021.08.02.02.01] -- Explain the function of the fuel system: lines;
   centrifugal boost pump; pressure valves; fuel shut-off valve; filter,
   strainer; tanks (wing, tip, fuselage, tail); bafflers/baffles; sump; vent
   system; drain; fuel-quantity sensor; fuel-temperature sensor;
   refuelling/defueling system; fuel dump/jettison system.
2. [021.08.02.02.02] -- Name the main components of the fuel system and state
   their location and their function: trim fuel tanks; bafflers;
   refuelling/defueling system; fuel dump/jettison system. Remark: For
   completion of list, please see 021.08 01.02 (02..
3. [021.08.02.02.03] -- Interpret a typical fuel system schematic to the level
   of detail as found in an aircraft FCOM.

   pump fuel pressure.
5. [021.08.02.02.05] -- Describe the use and purpose of drip sticks (manual
   magnetic indicators) (may also be known as dip stick or drop stick).
6. [021.08.02.02.06] -- Explain the considerations for fitting a fuel

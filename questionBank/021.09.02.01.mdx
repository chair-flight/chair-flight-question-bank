# Types, characteristics and limitations

## Learning Objectives

1. [021.09.02.01.01] -- State the function of an aircraft battery.
2. [021.09.02.01.02] -- Name the types of rechargeable batteries used in
   aircraft: lead-acid; nickel-cadmium; lithium-ion; lithium-polymer.
3. [021.09.02.01.03] -- Compare the different battery types with respect to:
   load behaviour; charging characteristics; risk of thermal runaway.
4. [021.09.02.01.04] -- Explain the term "cell voltage" and describe how a
   battery may consist of several cells that combined provide the desirable
   voltage and capacity.
5. [021.09.02.01.05] -- Explain the difference between battery voltage and
   charging voltage.
6. [021.09.02.01.06] -- Define the term "capacity of batteries" and state the
   unit of measurement used.
7. [021.09.02.01.07] -- State the effect of temperature on battery capacity and
   performance.
8. [021.09.02.01.08] -- State that in the case of loss of all generated power
   (battery power only) the remaining electrical power is time-limited.
9. [021.09.02.01.09] -- Explain how lithium-type batteries pose a threat to
   aircraft safety and what affects this risk: numbers of batteries on board an
   aircraft including those brought on board by passengers; temperature, of both
   battery and environment; physical condition of the battery; battery charging.
10. [021.09.02.01.10] -- Describe how to contain a battery thermal runaway
    highlighting the following: how one cell can affect the neighbouring cells;
    challenges if it happens in an aircraft during flight.

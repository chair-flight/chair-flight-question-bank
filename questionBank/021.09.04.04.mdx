# Electrical load management and monitoring systems: automatic generators and bus switching during normal and failure operation, indications and warnings

## Learning Objectives

1. **021.09.04.04.01** -- Give examples of system control, monitoring and
   annunciators using the following terms: generator control unit (GCU) for
   monitoring generator output and providing network protection; exciter
   contactor/breaker/relay for control of generator exciter field; generator
   contactor/breaker/relay for connecting the generator to the network; bus-tie
   contactor/breaker/relay for connecting busbars together; generator switch on
   the flight deck for manual control of exciter contactor; IDG/CSD disconnect
   switch on the flight deck for mechanical disconnection of the generator;
   bus-tie switch on the flight deck with AUTO and OFF positions only.
2. **021.09.04.04.02** -- Describe, for normal and degraded modes of operation,
   the following functions of an electrical load management system on ground and
   in flight using the terms in 021.09 04 04 (01.: distribution; monitoring;
   protection in the event of incorrect voltage; protection in the event of
   incorrect frequency; protection in the event of a differential fault.
3. **021.09.04.04.03** -- Describe the requirement for monitoring the aircraft
   batteries.
4. **021.09.04.04.04** -- Explain the importance of monitoring the temperature of
   nickel-cadmium and lithium-type batteries.
5. **021.09.04.04.05** -- Interpret various different ammeter indications of an
   ammeter which monitors the charge current of the battery.

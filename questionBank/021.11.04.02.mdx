## Summary

### Tailpipe fire (torching)

An ignition of fuel that has previously puddled in the the turbine casing or
exhaust section. One of the most common scenarios for this to happen is after a failed
start attempt.

When this event occours a visible flame can be seen escaping from the exhaust pipe. entering
will increase but an engine fire warning is not triggered.

### Hot start

**NOTE: Hot start for turbine and piston engines are different phenomena**

Hot start is caused by improper start technique. When starting a jet engine, the compressor
is spooled up to generate enough cooling flow around the combustion chamber, before ignition
is attempted.

Incorrect fuel scheduling, i.e.: starting ignition too soon, can cause a hot start since
there is not enough cooling flow to keep the combustion stable. Temperature in the combustion
chamber will increase rapidly leading to damage.

Another cause pilot's should be aware for hot starts, is starting the engine with a strong
tail wind. The wind will reduce the amount of air flow around the combustion chamber potentially
leading to a hot start.

### Abortive (hung) start

### No N1 rotation

### Freewheel failure

### No FADEC indications

  <Option id="gLGNk66rD2-1" subject="tailpipe fire">
    Fuel that has puddled in the turbine casing or exhaust during start-up may
    ignite. It can cause a well visible jet flame from the reward side of the
    engine
  </Option>
  <Option
    id="gLGNk66rD2-2"
    why="Describes a tailpipe fire, however, EGT will increase, not remain constant."
  >
    Fuel that has puddled in the turbine casing or exhaust during start-up may
    ignite. EGT will remain constant.
  </Option>
  <Option
    id="gLGNk66rD2-3"
    why="Describes a tailpipe fire, however, an engine fire alarm is not usually triggered."
  >
    Fuel that has puddled in the turbine casing or exhaust during start-up may
    ignite. An engine fire warning will trigger in the cockpit.
  </Option>
  <Option id="gLGNk66rD2-4" subject="hot start">
    The engine is started too early before enough air flow exists around the
    combustion chamber, resulting in a rapid increase of EGT beyond limits.
  </Option>
  <Option
    id="gLGNk66rD2-15"
    why="describe a hot start, except that in a hot start the engine does not flame out."
  >
    The engine is started too early before enough air flow exists around the
    combustion chamber, resulting in flameout and engine shutdown

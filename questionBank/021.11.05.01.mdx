# Thrust, performance aspects, and limitations

## Learning Objectives

1. **021.11.05.01.01** -- Describe the variation of thrust and specific fuel
   consumption with altitude at constant TAS.
2. **021.11.05.01.02** -- Describe the variation of thrust and specific fuel
   consumption with TAS at constant altitude.
3. **021.11.05.01.03** -- Explain the term "flat-rated engine" by describing the
   change of take-off thrust, turbine inlet temperature and engine rpm with
   outside air temperature (OAT).
4. **021.11.05.01.04** -- Define the term "engine pressure ratio" (EPR).
5. **021.11.05.01.05** -- Explain the use of reduced (flexible) and derated
   thrust for take-off, and explain the advantages and disadvantages when
   compared with a full-rated take-off.
6. **021.11.05.01.06** -- Describe the effects of use of bleed air on rpm, EGT,
   thrust, and specific fuel consumption.

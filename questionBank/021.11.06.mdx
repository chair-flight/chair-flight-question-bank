## Summary

Auxiliary Power Units (APU)s are small gas turbines usually located at the back of the aircraft
that drive an electrical generator to power aircraft systems. They are typically used on the ground
before the main engines are turned on.

Additional to supplying electical power, APUs can also supply compressed air for starting the main
engine or for air conditioning

Due to its secondary role, APUs rely on only a "Fault status" indicator to be monitored. Similarly,
APUs are usually started by a flick of a switch.

Since the APU primary role is to supply electrical power, its setup is significantly simpler than
the one for main engines, mostly because there is no need for a Constant Speed Drive: the APU already
operates at a constant speed. However, because of this it's not possible to run this generator in
parallel with the main engine generators. As such, when selecting the APU as a power source, the
other sources are disconnected. Regardless, as all other generators, the APU supplies power in
three-phase, 115-120V, 400Hz AC.

APUS must be equiped with an automatic shutdown protection system that activates when:

- EGT limit is exceeded,
- APU Fire
- Low oil pressure
- High oil temperature

In any engine, Low oil pressure typically indicates a leak, which will eventually result
in either overheating or not enough lubrification causing mechanical damage. High oil pressure is
usually not problematic and is kept in check by pressure release valves.

Remember: `High Temperature and Low Pressure => BAD!`.

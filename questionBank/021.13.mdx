<Question id="hlVdewYOvD" variant="oneCorrect" lo={[""]}>
  <Text>
    Which of these statements concerning oxygen on board of passenger transport
    aeroplanes is correct?
  </Text>
  <Option id="hlVdewYOvD-1" correct>
    Portable oxygen bottles in the cabin are primarily intended for first aid
    purposes.
  </Option>
  <Option id="hlVdewYOvD-2" correct>
    After being activated a chemical oxygen generator produces heat.
  </Option>
  <Option id="hlVdewYOvD-3" correct>
    Chemical oxygen generators are provided with an heat shield.
  </Option>
  <Option id="hlVdewYOvD-4" correct>
    Lavatories must be fitted with a fixed oxygen system that is activated at
    the same time as the cabin system.
  </Option>
  <Option
    id="hlVdewYOvD-5"
    why="lavatories must be equipped with an oxygen system as any other cabin location"
  >
    Since lavatories are not fitted with an oxygen system, they should be
    evacuated quickly in case of decompression.
  </Option>
  <Option id="hlVdewYOvD-6" why="chemical generators heat up when activated">
    After being activated a chemical oxygen generator does not produce any heat.
  </Option>
  <Option
    id="hlVdewYOvD-7"
    why="chemical generators typically have a lifespan of less than 15 mins as they are intended to supply oxygen only during enough time to allow the aircraft to descend below 10.000ft"
  >
    A chemical oxygen generator is able to provide oxygen for at least one hour.
  </Option>
  <Option id="hlVdewYOvD-8" why="their primary use is for first aid purposes.">
    Portable oxygen bottles are primarily intended for use in case the chemical
    oxygen generators fail.
  </Option>

  <Text>An oxygen supply system must be kept free of oil or grease as...</Text>
  <Option
    id="dTsenQFPvk-1"
    correct
    why="Spontaneous in this case means 'without the need of a spark'"
  >
    these substances can catch fire spontaneously in the presence of oxygen.
  </Option>
  <Option id="dTsenQFPvk-2" correct>
    the interaction of oil and and oxygen creates a fire hazard.
  </Option>
  <Option id="dTsenQFPvk-3">
    these substances could block the oxygen mask filters.
  </Option>
  <Option id="dTsenQFPvk-4">
    The interaction of oil-based products and oxygen creates a non-flammable
    smoke, which reduces visibility.
  </Option>
  <Option id="dTsenQFPvk-5">
    the breathing oxygen could be contaminated by these substances.
  </Option>
  <Option id="dTsenQFPvk-6">
    Oxygen absorbs oil and grease particles, causing the oxygen to become toxic.
  </Option>
  <Option
    id="dTsenQFPvk-7"
    why="Although correct, maintaining good oil lubrication properties is not even close to a priority in an oxygen system."
  >
    The interaction of oxygen and oil-based products reduces the lubricating
    capacity of those products.
  </Option>
  <Option
    id="dTsenQFPvk-8"
    why="no spark is necessary. 100% oxygen is usually enough to ignite most combustible mixtures"

    these substances mixed with oxygen could catch fire in the presence of a
    spark.

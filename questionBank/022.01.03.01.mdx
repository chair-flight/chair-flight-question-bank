# Units for fuel, measurements, fuel gauges

## Learning Objectives

1. **022.01.03.01.01** -- State that the quantity of fuel can be measured by volume or mass.
2. **022.01.03.01.02** -- List the following units used for fuel quantity: kilogramme; pound; litres; gallons (US and imperial).
3. **022.01.03.01.03** -- Convert between the various units.
4. **022.01.03.01.04** -- Explain the parameters that can affect the measurement of the volume or mass of the fuel in a fuel tank: temperature; aircraft accelerations and attitudes; and explain how the fuel-gauge system design compensates for these changes.
5. **022.01.03.01.05** -- Describe and explain the operating principles of the following types of fuel gauges: float system; capacitance-type of fuel-gauge system. ultrasound-type of fuel-gauge system: to be introduced at a later date.
6. **022.01.03.01.06** -- Describe and complete a typical post-refuelling procedure for a pilot: recording the volume that was filled; converting to the appropriate unit used by the aircraft fuel gauge(s) to compare the actual indicated fuel content to the calculated fuel content; assess appropriate action if the numbers does not compare.

  </Text>
  <Option
    id="y2KI9Mljoc-1"
    correct
    why="upon failure, the fuel indicator will fail 'safe', that is, it will slowly move towards indicating 0 fuel so that it never risks indicating that a fuel tank has more fuel than it actually has."

    A full deflection of the gauge to empty

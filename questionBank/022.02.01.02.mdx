# Pitot/static system: design and errors

## Learning Objectives

1. **022.02.01.02.01** -- Describe the design and the operating principle of a:
   - static port/source;
   - pitot tube;
   - combined pitot/static probe.
2. **022.02.01.02.02** -- For each of these indicate the various locations and
   describe the following associated errors and how to correct, minimise the
   effect of or compensate for them:
   - position errors;
   - instrument errors;
   - errors due to a non-longitudinal axial flow (including manoeuvre-induced
     errors).
3. **022.02.01.02.03** -- Describe a typical pitot/static system and list the
   possible outputs.
4. **022.02.01.02.04** -- Explain the redundancy and the interconnections that
   typically exist in complex pitot/static systems found in large aircraft.
5. **022.02.01.02.05** -- Explain the purpose of pitot/static system heating.
6. **022.02.01.02.06** -- Describe alternate static sources and their effects
   when used, particularly in unpressurised aircraft.
7. **022.02.01.02.07** -- Describe a modern pitot static system using
   solid-state sensors near the pitot probe or static port converting the air
   data to numerical data (electrical signals) before being sent to the air-data
   computer(s).

      continue to display the reading at which the blockage occurred
   </Option>      
  <Explanation>
   The altimeter's only input source is static pressure. 
   If this becomes blocked, the instrument will simply 'freeze',
   indicating the altitude at which the blockage occurred.

The Airspeed indicator has 2 inputs: The pitot tube and the static port.
Velocity is computed from the difference between the total pressure and the
static pressure. The higher the difference, the higher the speed.

When the static port becomes blocked, the base value for this comparison
stagnates.

In case of a climb, the outside air pressure will be decreasing, while our
instrument will be measuring a value that is higher than the real value. The
total pressure pressure will also be decreasing, meaning that our instrument
will begin to under read the velocity.

The opposite is true during a descent where the static port will be
under-reading the static pressure, but the dynamic pressure will keep
increasing, leading to an over-read of the velocity.

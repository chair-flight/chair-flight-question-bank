# Purposes of systems, display systems, checklists

## Learning Objectives

1. **022.13.04.01.01** -- State the purpose of the following systems: engine
   instruments centralised display unit; crew alerting system/aircraft display
   unit; facility for appropriate on-screen checklists; that the aircraft
   systems display unit enables the display of normal and degraded modes of
   operation of the aircraft systems; that the systems/aircraft display unit is
   able to show pictorial systems diagrams/schematics and associated parameters.
2. **022.13.04.01.02** -- Describe the similarities to EFIS with regard to basic
   system architecture.
3. **022.13.04.01.03** -- Give the following different names by which engine
   parameters, crew warnings, aircraft systems and procedures display systems
   are known: multifunction display unit (MFDU); engine indication and crew
   alerting systems (EICASs); engine and warning display (EWD); electronic
   centralised aircraft monitor (ECAM); systems display (S/D).
4. **022.13.04.01.04** -- Give the names of the following different display
   systems and describe their main functions: vehicle engine monitoring display
   (VEMD); integrated instruments display system (IIDS).
5. **022.13.04.01.05** -- State the purpose of a mission display unit.
6. **022.13.04.01.06** -- Describe the architecture of each system and give
   examples of display.
7. **022.13.04.01.07** -- Explain why awareness of the consequences of the actions
   commanded by the automatic checklist is required.
8. **022.13.04.01.08** -- Explain the limited ability of the computer to assess a
   situation other than using the exceedance of certain thresholds to trigger
   the main and subsequent events and programmed actions.
9. **022.13.04.01.09** -- Describe an appropriate procedure for following an
   on-screen checklist associated with a failure scenario including the
   following: confirm the failure with the other flight crew member prior to
   performing any of the actions; seek confirmation prior to manipulating any
   guarded switches or thrust levers; follow the checklist slowly and
   methodically; assess the possible implications of making certain selections,
   such as opening the fuel cross-feed if there is a fuel leak even though the
   electronic checklist may ask for the action.

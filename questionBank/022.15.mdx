# DIGITAL CIRCUITS AND COMPUTERS

## Learning Objectives

1. **022.15.01.01.01** -- Define a "computer" as a machine for manipulating data
   according to a list of instructions.
2. **022.15.01.01.02** -- Explain the term "bus" being used as a term for a
   facility (wiring, optical fibre, etc.) transferring data between different
   parts of a computer, both internally and externally.
3. **022.15.01.01.03** -- Define the terms "hardware" and "software".
4. **022.15.01.01.04** -- With the help of the relevant 022 references, give
   examples of airborne computers and list the possible peripheral equipment for
   each system, such as:
   - ADC with pitot probe(s),
   - static port(s) and indicators;
   - FMS with GPS,
   - CDU/MCDU and ND;
   - GPWS with radio altimeter,
   - ADC and ND.

  <Text variant="oneCorrect">A computer is a ...</Text>
  <Option
    id="FYBCGwzg-1"
    correct
    why="This is the word by word definition that EASA expects you to memorize."
  >
    A machine for manipulating data according to a list of instructions
  </Option>
  <Option
    id="FYBCGwzg-3"
    why="Definition of an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)."
  >
    A digital circuit that performs basic operations.
  </Option>
  <Option
    id="FYBCGwzg-4"
    why="Not necessarily true: computers predate microprocessors by a few decades."
  >
    a microprocessor.
  </Option>
  <Option
    id="FYBCGwzg-5"
    why="Not a very accurate definition since a computer typically includes memory to store instructions and data."
  >

  <Text variant="oneCorrect">
    In a computer architecture, a "bus" is a system that:
  </Text>
  <Option id="3whqhFv2-0">performs basic logic operations.</Option>
  <Option id="3whqhFv2-1">performs basic arithmetic operations.</Option>
  <Option id="3whqhFv2-2" correct>
    transfers data between computer components.
  </Option>
  <Option id="3whqhFv2-3">
    ensures sequencing and co-ordination of operations.
  </Option>
  <Explanation>
    The most popular computer bus, is the USB (Universal Serial Bus), and it
    allows to connect pretty much any device to a computer. Other buses exist
    (ie.: SATA for disk drives)

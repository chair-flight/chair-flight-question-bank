# Frequency bands, sidebands, single sideband

## Learning Objectives

1. **062.01.01.03.01** -- List the bands of the frequency spectrum for
   electromagnetic waves:
   - very low frequency (VLF): 3-30 kHz;
   - low frequency (LF): 30-300 kHz;
   - medium frequency (MF): 300-3 000 kHz;
   - high frequency (HF): 3-30 MHz;
   - very high frequency (VHF): 30-300 MHz;
   - ultra-high frequency (UHF): 300-3 000 MHz;
   - super high frequency (SHF): 3-30 GHz;
   - extremely high frequency (EHF): 30-300 GHz.
2. **062.01.01.03.02** -- State that when a carrier wave is modulated, the
   resultant radiation consists of the carrier frequency plus additional upper
   and lower sidebands.
3. **062.01.01.03.03** -- State that HF meteorological information for aircraft
   in flight (VOLMET) and HF two-way communication use a single sideband.
4. **062.01.01.03.04** -- State that the following abbreviations
   (classifications according to International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
   regulations) are used for aviation applications:
   - N0N: carrier without modulation as used by non-directional radio beacons
     (NDBs);
   - A1A: carrier with keyed Morse code modulation as used by NDBs;
   - A2A: carrier with amplitude modulated Morse code as used by NDBs;
   - A3E: carrier with amplitude modulated speech used for communication
     (VHF-COM).

## Summary

### Bands of Frequencies

| Full Name                | Abbreviation | Range          |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| very low frequency       | VLF          | 3-30 kHz;      |
| low frequency            | LF           | 30-300 kHz;    |
| medium frequency         | MF           | 300-3 000 kHz; |
| high frequency           | HF           | 3-30 MHz;      |
| very high frequency      | VHF          | 30-300 MHz;    |
| ultra-high frequency     | UHF          | 300-3 000 MHz; |
| super high frequency     | SHF          | 3-30 GHz;      |
| extremely high frequency | EHF          | 30-300 GHz.    |

**Suggestion**: Memorize 30-300 MHz for VHF, which is the range of frequencies
most used in aviation. You can then just remind yourself that each range is 10
times higher or lower.

### ITU abbreviations

- N0N: carrier without modulation as used by non-directional radio beacons
  (NDBs);
- A1A: carrier with keyed Morse code modulation as used by NDBs;
- A2A: carrier with amplitude modulated Morse code as used by NDBs;
- A3E: carrier with amplitude modulated speech used for communication (VHF-COM).

- Fist Letter: Method of modulation
  - N -> No modulation
  - A -> Amplitude modulation
- Second Number: Type/Nature of the signals modulating the main carrier
  - 0 -> No Modulation (N0)
  - 1 ->
  - 2 ->
  - 3 -> Modulated speech
- Third Letter: Type/Nature of Information being transmitted
  - N -> No information
  - A -> Aural telegraphy, intended to be decoded by hear (i.e.: Morse code)
  - E -> Voice communications

### SSB

SSB is a form of amplitude modulation that allows for more efficient use of
bandwidth at a cost of increased device complexity and more difficult tuning to
the frequency. It is used for:

- VOLMET
- HF two way communication

  <Explanation>
    {`This question is really asking you the order of magnitude of the amplitude
    for waves used in givent spectrum.
    
    For VHF (30-300 MHz) transmissions: 
    
    $$
    \frac{3\times10^{8} m/s}{(30 - 300)\times10^{6} hz} \approx (1 - 10)m
    $$

    The best answer is therefore metres.

    For DME (960 - 1213 MHz)

    $$
    \frac{3\times10^{8} m/s}{(960 - 1213)\times10^{6} hz} \approx (0.24 - 0.3)m
    $$

    The best answer is therefore Decimetres (0.1 metres = 1 Decimetre).`}

# Coverage and range

## Learning Objectives

1. **062.02.02.03.01** -- State that the power of the transmitter limits the
   range of an NDB.
2. **062.02.02.03.02** -- Explain the relationship between power and range.
3. **062.02.02.03.03** -- Describe the propagation path of NDB radio waves with
   respect to the ionosphere and the Earth"s surface.
4. **062.02.02.03.04** -- Explain that the interference between sky waves and
   ground waves leads to "fading".
5. **062.02.02.03.05** -- Define that the accuracy the pilot has to fly the
   required bearing in order to be considered established during approach,
   according to ICAO Doc 8168, has to be within plus/minus 5 degrees.
6. **062.02.02.03.06** -- State that there is no warning indication of NDB
   failure.

## Summary

## Questions

5. **062.02.02.03.05** -- Define that the accuracy the pilot has to fly the
   required bearing in order to be considered established during approach,
   according to ICAO Doc 8168, has to be within plus/minus 5 degrees.

VOR

1.  **062.02.03.04.01** -- Define that the accuracy the pilot has to fly the
    required bearing in order to be considered established on a VOR track when
    flying approach procedures, according to ICAO Doc 8168, has to be within the
    half-full scale deflection of the required track.

ILS 5. **062.02.05.04.05** -- Explain the following in accordance with ICAO Doc
8168: the accuracy the pilot has to fly the ILS LOC to be considered established
on an ILS track is within the half-full scale deflection of the required track;
the aircraft has to be established within the half-scale deflection of the LOC
before starting descent on the GP; the pilot has to fly the ILS GP to a maximum
of half-scale fly-up deflection of the GP in order to stay in protected
airspace.

# Principles

## Learning Objectives

1. [062.02.03.01.01] -- Explain the working principle of VOR using the following
   general terms: reference phase; variable phase; phase difference.
2. [062.02.03.01.02] -- State that the frequency band allocated to VOR according
   to ICAO Annex 10 is VHF, and the frequencies used are 108.0-117.975 MHz.
3. [062.02.03.01.03] -- State that frequencies within the allocated VOR range
   108.0-111.975 MHz, which have an odd number in the first decimal place, are
   used by instrument landing system (ILS).
4. [062.02.03.01.04] -- State that the following types of VOR are in operation:
   conventional VOR (CVOR): a first-generation VOR station emitting signals by
   means of a rotating antenna; Doppler VOR (DVOR): a second-generation VOR
   station emitting signals by means of a combination of fixed antennas
   utilising the Doppler principle; en-route VOR for use by IFR traffic;
   terminal VOR (TVOR): a station with a shorter range used as part of the
   approach and departure structure at major aerodromes; test VOR (VOT): a VOR
   station emitting a signal to test VOR indicators in an aircraft.
5. [062.02.03.01.05] -- State that automatic terminal information service (ATIS)
   information is transmitted on VOR frequencies.
6. [062.02.03.01.06] -- List the three main components of VOR airborne
   equipment: the antenna; the receiver; the indicator.
7. [062.02.03.01.07] -- Describe the identification of a VOR in terms of
   Morse-code letters and additional plain text.
8. [062.02.03.01.08] -- State that according to ICAO Annex 10, a VOR station has
   an automatic ground monitoring system.
9. [062.02.03.01.09] -- State that failure of the VOR station to stay within the
   required limits can cause the removal of identification and navigation
   components from the carrier or radiation to cease.

# VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR): Principles

## Learning Objectives

1. **062.02.03.01.01** -- Explain the working principle of VOR using the
   following general terms: reference phase; variable phase; phase difference.
2. **062.02.03.01.02** -- State that the frequency band allocated to VOR
   according to ICAO Annex 10 is VHF, and the frequencies used are 108.0-117.975
   MHz.
3. **062.02.03.01.03** -- State that frequencies within the allocated VOR range
   108.0-111.975 MHz, which have an odd number in the first decimal place, are
   used by instrument landing system (ILS).
4. **062.02.03.01.04** -- State that the following types of VOR are in
   operation: conventional VOR (CVOR): a first-generation VOR station emitting
   signals by means of a rotating antenna; Doppler VOR (DVOR): a
   second-generation VOR station emitting signals by means of a combination of
   fixed antennas utilising the Doppler principle; en-route VOR for use by IFR
   traffic; terminal VOR (TVOR): a station with a shorter range used as part of
   the approach and departure structure at major aerodromes; test VOR (VOT): a
   VOR station emitting a signal to test VOR indicators in an aircraft.
5. **062.02.03.01.05** -- State that automatic terminal information service
   (ATIS) information is transmitted on VOR frequencies.
6. **062.02.03.01.06** -- List the three main components of VOR airborne
   equipment: the antenna; the receiver; the indicator.
7. **062.02.03.01.07** -- Describe the identification of a VOR in terms of
   Morse-code letters and additional plain text.
8. **062.02.03.01.08** -- State that according to ICAO Annex 10, a VOR station
   has an automatic ground monitoring system.
9. **062.02.03.01.09** -- State that failure of the VOR station to stay within
   the required limits can cause the removal of identification and navigation
   components from the carrier or radiation to cease.

  </Text>
  <Option id='uWiU0STpv8-1' subject={['0º']} why='true for 0º.'>North</Option>
  <Option id='uWiU0STpv8-2' subject={['90º']} why='true for 90º.'>East</Option>
  <Option id='uWiU0STpv8-3' subject={['180º']} why='true for 180º.'>South</Option>
  <Option id='uWiU0STpv8-4' subject={['270º']} why='true for 270º.'>West</Option>
  <Explanation>
    A VOR works by sending two signals. A 30Hz reference signal is sent
    omni directional and serves as a reference. A second directional signal 
    is sent by a rotating limacon at a frequency of 30Hz.

    The phase difference of these 2 signals can be measured. Conveniently,
    the pase difference corresponds to the degrees magnetic we are from the
    station, i.e.: a phase difference of 270º means we are west of the station.

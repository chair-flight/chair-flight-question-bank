# Principles

## Learning Objectives

1. **062.02.05.01.01** -- Name the three main components of an ILS: the
   localiser (LOC); the glide path (GP); range information (markers or DME).
2. **062.02.05.01.02** -- State the site locations of the ILS components: the
   LOC antenna should be located on the extension of the runway centre line at
   the stop-end; the GP antenna should be locate beyond the runway threshold,
   laterally displaced to the side of the runway centre line.
3. **062.02.05.01.03** -- Explain that marker beacons produce radiation patterns
   to indicate predetermined distances from the threshold along the ILS GP.
4. **062.02.05.01.04** -- State that marker beacons are sometimes replaced by a
   DME paired with the LOC frequency.
5. **062.02.05.01.05** -- State that in the ILS LOC frequency assigned band
   108.0-111.975 MHz, only frequencies which have an odd number in the first
   decimal are ILS LOC frequencies.
6. **062.02.05.01.06** -- State that the GP operates in the UHF band.
7. **062.02.05.01.07** -- Describe the use of the 90-Hz and the 150-Hz signals
   in the LOC and GP transmitters/receivers, stating how the signals at the
   receivers vary with angular deviation.
8. **062.02.05.01.08** -- State that the UHF GP frequency is selected
   automatically by being paired with the LOC frequency.
9. **062.02.05.01.09** -- Explain that both the LOC and the GP antenna radiates
   side lobes (false beams) which can give rise to false centre-line and false
   GP indication.
10. **062.02.05.01.10** -- Explain that the back beam from the LOC antenna may
    be used as a published "non-precision approach".
11. **062.02.05.01.11** -- State that the recommended GP is 3 degrees .
12. **062.02.05.01.12** -- Name the frequency, modulation and identification
    assigned to all marker beacons. All marker beacons operate on 75-MHz carrier
    frequency. The modulation frequencies of the audio are: outer marker: low;
    middle marker: medium; inner marker: high. The audio frequency modulation
    (for identification) is the continuous modulation of the audio frequency and
    is keyed as follows: outer marker: 2 dashes per second continuously; middle
    marker: a continuous series of alternate dots and dashes; inner marker: 6
    dots per second continuously. The outer-marker cockpit indicator is coloured
    blue, the middle marker amber, and the inner marker white.
13. **062.02.05.01.13** -- State that the final-approach area contains a fix or
    facility that permits verification of the ILS GP-altimeter relationship. The
    outer marker or DME is usually used for this purpose.

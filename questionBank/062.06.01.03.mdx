# Errors and factors affecting accuracy

## Learning Objectives

1. **062.06.01.03.01** -- List the most significant factors that affect
   accuracy:
   - ionospheric propagation delay;
   - dilution of precision;
   - satellite clock error;
   - satellite orbital variations;
   - multipath effects.
2. **062.06.01.03.02** -- State that a user equivalent range error (UERE) can be
   computed from all these factors.
3. **062.06.01.03.03** -- State that the error from the ionospheric propagation
   delay (IPD) can be reduced by modelling, using a model of the ionosphere, or
   can almost be eliminated by using two frequencies.
4. **062.06.01.03.04** -- State that ionospheric delay is the most significant
   error.
5. **062.06.01.03.05** -- State that dilution of precision arises from the
   geometry and number of satellites in view. It is called geometric dilution of
   precision (GDOP).
6. **062.06.01.03.06** -- State that the UERE in combination with the geometric
   dilution of precision (GDOP) allows for an estimation of position accuracy.
7. **062.06.01.03.07** -- State that errors in the satellite orbits are due to:
   solar winds; gravitation of the Sun and the Moon.

## Summary

### Ionospheric propagation delay

### Dilution of precision

GPS systems are based on the principle of triangulation, that is, the
determination of a position based on the distance from a set of know positions.
The quality of this determination is directly proportional to the position of
the satellites. If the satellites are closely positioned the quality of the
"triangulation" will be significantly poorer than if you have a set of
satellites that are well separated.

### Satellite clock error

The satellite atomic clock can and will experience noise and clock drift errors.
This error can be measured by comparing the atomic clock reading with ground
atomic clocks. The clock error is sent to receivers as part of the navigation
message.

Together with satellite orbital variations, clock errors are known as "Ephemeris
errors".

### Satellite orbital variations

Satellite position is subject to error caused by gravitational forces of
celestial bodies, solar winds, among others. The precise position of a satellite
is checked every 12 hours and the up to date position error is sent to receivers
as part of the navigation message.

Together With clock errors, orbital variation errors are known as "Ephemeris
errors".

### Multipath Effects

GPS signals can reflect off terrain and buildings arriving at the receiver with
delays. Multipath errors due to long bounces, are easy to identify and discard.
Errors from small bounces are significantly harder, but can be minimized by
using specialized antennas that better measure the "direction" of the incoming
signal and split bounced signals based on their incoming direction.

# Errors and factors affecting accuracy

## Learning Objectives

1. [062.06.01.03.01] -- List the most significant factors that affect accuracy:
   ionospheric propagation delay; dilution of precision; satellite clock error;
   satellite orbital variations; multipath.
2. [062.06.01.03.02] -- State that a user equivalent range error (UERE) can be
   computed from all these factors.
3. [062.06.01.03.03] -- State that the error from the ionospheric propagation
   delay (IPD) can be reduced by modelling, using a model of the ionosphere, or
   can almost be eliminated by using two frequencies.
4. [062.06.01.03.04] -- State that ionospheric delay is the most significant
   error.
5. [062.06.01.03.05] -- State that dilution of precision arises from the
   geometry and number of satellites in view. It is called geometric dilution of
   precision (GDOP).
6. [062.06.01.03.06] -- State that the UERE in combination with the geometric
   dilution of precision (GDOP) allows for an estimation of position accuracy.
7. [062.06.01.03.07] -- State that errors in the satellite orbits are due to:
   solar winds; gravitation of the Sun and the Moon.
